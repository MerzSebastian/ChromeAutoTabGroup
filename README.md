# AutoTabGroup
**AutoTabGroup** is a small Chrome extension which automatically sorts your tabs into groups.

## Add extension to Chrome
Go to your chrome extension settings by clicking [HERE](chrome://extensions/).

Then you need to activate developer mode in the top right corner. 

After that, 3 new buttons should appear. Click on "load unpacked extension" and select the AutoTabGroup folder from this reposetory.

I would suggest pinning it to your action-bar so that easy access is given.

## Settings

There are only two small settings which can be accessed by right-clicking the action-bar icon. 

### Collapse on click
This is activated by default. If this gets deactivated, no groups will be collapsed after grouping.
### Icon darkmode
This is activated by default. If this gets deactivated, the action-bar icon color will change to black.
